# arrow_pres

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to compare the tools available in Apache Arrow to the commonly used tidyverse and data table methods when dealing with big data.

### Getting started:

The project was created using Rv4.0.5 and requires the user to knit the Rmd document to a slidy document, which uses the dummy_df.R script and the accompanying CSS file to render. The packages required to knit the script are listed in the first coding chunk of the Rmd, the project originally leveraged the renv package, however, this is not necessary.
